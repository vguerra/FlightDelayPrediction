## Introduction

In this report, we present the work done to implement a Machine Learning pipeline to train a model that predicts delays in US Flights.
We take as reference a paper published at beginning of 2016 [Using Scalable Data Mining for Predicting Flight Delays](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292539590_Using_Scalable_Data_Mining_for_Predicting_Flight_Delays) by Belcastro, Marozzo, Talia and Trunfio.
